Describe Number Based on Divisibility
Write a function describe_number that takes an integer as input and returns:

"Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3.
"Buzz" if divisible by 5.
"FizzBuzz" if divisible by both 3 and 5.
"Normal" if it is divisible by neither.
NOTE: This is a function type question, you don't have to take input or print the output, just have to complete the required function definition.

Example
describe_number(9) -> "Fizz"
describe_number(10) -> "Buzz"
describe_number(15) -> "FizzBuzz"
describe_number(7) -> "Normal"
